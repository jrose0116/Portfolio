                I am currently enrolled at Stevens Institute of 
                Technology pursuing a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity.
                As a student, I have excelled in my programming
                courses. I was at the top of my class for Python,
                Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Scheme courses,
                which I learned through DrRacket. I have explored
                Assembly, Express, and mySQL in my free-time 
                during the School semester. I have also excelled in
                physics, english, and probability/statistics. I am 
                enrolled in a co-op program which means that I
                will be seeking internship opportunities for
                alternating quarters starting in Spring of 2023. I
                have also unofficially tutored many classmates in
                Python, Scheme, Java, and Website Development
                which includes HTML, CSS, JS, and Express. I am
                very research oriented meaning that I will likely
                seek outside documentation to further my 
                knowledge of a certain topic. My logic skills have
                been tested repeatedly throughout my enrollment and
                I have yet to fall short. I plan to work on
                getting more professional connections on campus
                and be more adventurous when it comes to
                starting new projects in order to get an edge in
                this competitive field.

                Over the summer of 2022, I decided to get some
                professional experience by working in sales. I made 
                many new connections and honed my phone skills.
                I was immediately thrown into the deep end into
                one  of the most intense markets out there. There
                are hundreds of different titles for my role such
                as Customer Experience Representative or Business
                Development Center Representative. My job
                entailed guiding customers to purchase new and
                preowned vehicles via follow-up calls, emails, as
                well as text. Most times, I would have to sell a
                vehicle to a customer before they even walk into 
                the dealership. I had no prior knowledge of most
                of the vehicles being sold at the dealership so I
                would have to find information on short notice
                through their databases. I dressed professionally to
                fit the position of sales representative. By the
                middle of the summer, I felt as though my efforts
                made me into a valuable resource to the company.
                I gained plenty of experience with a Customer
                Resource Manager, also known as a CRM. I worked
                as a full-time employee for a temporary period.
                The overall experience was life-changing.

                As an intern at Hatteras Press, I gained some entry
                level experience in marketting. Most of my
                internship was based on back-end programming
                within their website and orders database. I looked
                into operating system tasks and VPN systems as
                well as an emailing list. I was in close contact with
                one of the managers at Hatteras Press and he
                guided me to learn from several of his executive
                employees and co-workers. We discussed many details
                about their website as well as
                the machinery used to print in different materials,
                sizes, and purposes. I dressed professionally over
                zoom meetings and assisted in organizing
                documents and excel sheets.

                highschool. I worked with two other individuals
                and we built an app that won over our district's
                representative. We worked with Android Studio as
                well as making several demos. In this team, I
                primarily worked on the main UI that was present
                on all views as well as the linking of the views.
                I also edited and rendered the video submitted with
                the application.

                As a Swim Instructor, I was immediately required to
                be dependable and comforting. I taught children
                from only a few months old to 12 years old the 
                basics of swimming. As a lifeguard, I had to be 
                attentive and professional at all times to comfort 
                parents and make the pool environment safe. 
                Through this, I was certified in CPR and
                lifeguarding. I adapted myself to be presentable to
                parents and entertain children while teaching
                safety procedures. Following my first month after
                training, I was deemed Employee of the Month
                and set an example for my co-workers.

                In highschool, my strong suits were math and
                programming. I met many dependable people that
                I still cooperate with to this day. My highschool was
                mostly geared towards college preparation. I took
                electives in visual design and programming. My
                visual design course helps me make decisions
                when building UI and front-end views. I was at the
                top of my class in my Python and Java courses. I
                obtained knowledge in the Adobe Suite which
                includes Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign,
                Premiere, After Effects and Animate.
