                        <p class="mt-3 mb-5">This problem was solved using recursion to split the array into two, sorting them, then recombining them by traversing
                            each of the two sorted arrays. The recursively split elements merge up and sort while merging until the array is sorted.
                            One special case used is to return if the array has one or less values. The second special case is if every item in the array is the same.
                            In this case, it would be best to save the time if the array or parts of the array are the same element adjacent to each other.
                            I also added an optional parameter for tabbing over so the recursion is easier to see. Test cases are included.

                            Here is the problem: There's a staircase with N steps, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number
                            of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters. What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could
                            climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time. Generalize your function to take in X.
